Board - Any Raspberry Pi Pico, including the original, will run this code.
Wiring is the same for all boards

Dispaly - most HUB75 64 x 32 displays should work. Beware ultra-cheap boards. Double-check if it's been used with CircuitPython / Raspberry Pi Pico projects. Two examples below (there are many other sizes at these & different stores)
Adafruit sells these (I love Adafruit - high quality - great support): https://www.adafruit.com/product/2278 
And here is an ultra-cheap on AliExpress that seems to work:

Power Cable - the HUB75 power cable with U-shaped ground & power ends, plus 4 pin port to plug into the HUB75 display should be included with every display.
Power Supply - 
Power Adapter Plug - Female DC Power Adapter 2.1mm Jack to Screw Terminal Block
